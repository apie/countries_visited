# Countries Visited
Save which countries you have visited and show it on a map.

Based on:
 - https://leafletjs.com/examples/choropleth/
 
Dataset:
 - https://datahub.io/core/geo-countries#resource-countries (I modified it and have sliced the UK)
 
Inspired by:
 - The visited-map Couchsurfing used to have.
 
## Getting started
Read `start.bash` and you should be able to figure it out..
